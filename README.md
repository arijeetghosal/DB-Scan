                                                    -> Description: 


We have tried to implement image segmentation in this code using the DBSCAN algorithm. Density-based clustering refers to unsupervised learning methods that identify distinctive groups/clusters in the data, based on the idea that a cluster in data space is a contiguous region of high point density, separated from other such clusters by contiguous regions of low point density.
